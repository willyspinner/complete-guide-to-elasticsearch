# inverted index

essentially, after analysis of each document, we create an inverted index that can see how many of the terms (tokenized and filtered) of a query show up in the documents.

roughly speaking, an inverted speaking is a mapping of a field's terms and which documents contain each term.

e.g. if we search `pasta recipe`, we get:
