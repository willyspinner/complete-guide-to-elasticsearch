So far, we know how to add analyzers when initializing the index.

But how do we alter or add analyzers to already existing indices?



We have to `close` the index, add/change the analyzer, and then `open` it.

`open` and `close` means allowing and disallowing the ability to read and write respectively.



# closing the index

```http
POST /analyzers_test/_close
```

# put an analyzer into the index

```json
PUT /analyzers_test/_settings
{
    "analysis": {
        "analyzer": {
            "french_stop": {
                "type": "standard",
                "stopwords": "_french_"
            }
        }
    }
}
```



# opening the index

```http
POST /analyzers_test/_open
```
