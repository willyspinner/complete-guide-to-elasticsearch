# Using analyzers in mappings

when defining field mappings, we can directly specify which custom analyzer to use.

## Using a custom analyzer in field mappings

NOTE: the `my_analyzer` custom analyzer is already defined.

```
PUT /analyzers_test/_doc/_mapping
{
  "properties": {
    "description": {
      "type": "text",
      "analyzer": "my_analyzer"
    },
    "teaser": {
      "type": "text",
      "analyzer": "standard"
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding a test document

```
POST /analyzers_test/_doc/1
{
  "description": "drinking",
  "teaser": "drinking"
}
```

## Testing the mapping

```
GET /analyzers_test/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "teaser": {
        "value": "drinking"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The above query matches the doc with id 1. This is because it is under the `standard` analyzer, which doesn't stem. 

```
GET /analyzers_test/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "description": {
        "value": "drinking"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The above query matches nothing. This is because it is under the `my_analyzer` analyzer, which **does** stem. 

 Stemming isn't done in the query value itself (which is wierd? shouldn't it?), so it doesn't match the already stemmed 'drink' value in doc id 1.
