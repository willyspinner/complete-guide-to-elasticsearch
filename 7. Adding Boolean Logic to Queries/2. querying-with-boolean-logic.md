# Querying with boolean logic

`bool` queries add boolean logic to queries. We have to note about its relevance scoring method.

Recall the distinction between filter and query contexts. Term level queries can be filter context queries, since we want to see whether a term is present, in range, etc.

But match queries are query context, since they use the idea of relevance scoring.

`bool` queries can combine both filter and query contexts.

## Adding query clauses to the `must` key

```http
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        },
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`must` is a query method where the documents **must** adhere to the conditions in order to be a hit.

However, the `must` conditions also **contribute** to the document's relevance score. So again, the non-adhering documents are thrown out, but the hits are still sorted in terms of relevance.

## Moving the `range` query to the `filter` key

For filter context queries like `range`, when put in `must`, ES gives a match a score of 1 and unmatch a score of 0 (in which case, it won't be a hit).

But in terms of performance, it is better to put filter context queries into the `filter` key. ES can cache filter queries for subsequent searches. There is no notion of how 'well' the documents match.

```http
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {
          "range": {            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding a query clause to the `must_not` key

`must_not` queries reject any documents that have obey a condition. This is like the `filter` context.

`must_not` queries are considered for caching, just like `filter`. Although it is not always done.

```http
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ],
      "must_not": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "tuna"
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding a query clause to the `should` key

the `should` query means that when the queries within it match, it boosts the relevance score. Their match is not required, however.

So the `should` key can be used to define preferences.

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ],
      "must_not": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "tuna"
          }
        }
      ],
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parsley"
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## The behavior of `should` query clauses depends

in the absence of `must` and `filter` keys, the `should` key alone becomes a required match. Otherwise, if it is optional (but boosting score) for match, then we would unecessarily match many documents and eat up a lot of search time. 

```http
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "pasta"
          }
        }
      ],
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

So in the above, the `parmesan` `should` query is optional. When matched, it boosts the relevance score. 

```http
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example however, the `should` query becomes a `must` query as for reasons stated above.
