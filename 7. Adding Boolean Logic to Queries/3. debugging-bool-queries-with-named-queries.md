# Debugging `bool` queries with named queries

we can use named queries to see which `should` clauses a document matches, to try and make sense of the make up of the relevance score.

To do this, we just need to add a `_name` field in the clauses.

```http
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
    "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "match": {
                "ingredients.name": {
                  "query": "parmesan",
                  "_name": "parmesan_must"
                }
              }
            }
          ],
          "must_not": [
            {
              "match": {
                "ingredients.name": {
                  "query": "tuna",
                  "_name": "tuna_must_not"
                }
              }
            }
          ],
          "should": [
            {
              "match": {
                "ingredients.name": {
                  "query": "parsley",
                  "_name": "parsley_should"
                }
              }
            }
          ],
          "filter": [
            {
              "range": {
                "preparation_time_minutes": {
                  "lte": 15,
                  "_name": "prep_time_filter"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
    }
}
```

Within the results of every hit, we see :

```json
"matched_queries": [
          "prep_time_filter",
          "parmesan_must",
          "parsley_should"
        ]
```

which means that the three queries above matched, and gave the hit its score.

Notice how the `must_not` queries didn't match (and isn't written in `matched_queries`). If it did, then the document wouldn't be a hit.
