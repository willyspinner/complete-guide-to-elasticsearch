# Terms lookup mechanism

We can look up terms in one index with desired search term values in another index in a **better** way than making **two** client-side round trips (one to get those values, then one more to use those values in search).

When it’s needed to specify a `terms` filter with a lot of terms (query of multiple terms) it can be **beneficial** to **fetch** those **term** **values** from a **document** in an(other) **index**.

 A concrete example would be to filter tweets tweeted by your followers. Potentially the amount of user ids specified in the terms filter can be a lot. In this scenario it makes sense to use the terms filter’s terms lookup mechanism.

The terms lookup mechanism supports the following options:

| `index`   | The index to fetch the term values from.                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type`    | The type to fetch the term values from.                      |
| `id`      | The id of the document to fetch the term values from.        |
| `path`    | The **field** specified as **path** to fetch the actual values for the `terms` filter. |
| `routing` | A custom routing value to be used when retrieving the external terms doc. |

## Adding test data

```
PUT /users/_doc/1
{
  "name": "John Roberts",
  "following" : [2, 3]
}
```

```
PUT /users/_doc/2
{
  "name": "Elizabeth Ross",
  "following" : []
}
```

```
PUT /users/_doc/3
{
  "name": "Jeremy Brooks",
  "following" : [1, 2]
}
```

```
PUT /users/_doc/4
{
  "name": "Diana Moore",
  "following" : [3, 1]
}
```

```
PUT /stories/_doc/1
{
  "user": 3,
  "content": "Wow look, a penguin!"
}
```

```
PUT /stories/_doc/2
{
  "user": 1,
  "content": "Just another day at the office... #coffee"
}
```

```
PUT /stories/_doc/3
{
  "user": 1,
  "content": "Making search great again! #elasticsearch #elk"
}
```

```
PUT /stories/_doc/4
{
  "user": 4,
  "content": "Had a blast today! #rollercoaster #amusementpark"
}
```

```
PUT /stories/_doc/5
{
  "user": 4,
  "content": "Yay, I just got hired as an Elasticsearch consultant - so excited!"
}
```

```
PUT /stories/_doc/6
{
  "user": 2,
  "content": "Chilling at the beach @ Greece #vacation #goodtimes"
}
```

## Querying stories from a user's followers

```http
GET /stories/_search
{
    "query": {
        "terms": {
            "user": {
                "index": "users",
                "type": "_doc",
                "id": 1,
                "path": "following"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Internally the above query looks like this:

![image-20181229172018233](/Users/willyspinner/Desktop/elastic_tuts/complete-guide-to-elasticsearch/8. Joining Queries/assets/image-20181229172018233.png)



The main advantage of doing this is that data transfer is faster and network latency is slower. The other way of doing this would be to first send a query to ES to get the followers of a user with id 2, and then send another query with these followers.

We can just let ES do this automatically.

### keep in mind

that the more terms we put in our query, the slower the query gets. We should not query many terms all at once.
