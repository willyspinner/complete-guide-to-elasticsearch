# Querying child documents by parent

We saw how to query child documents by their parent id.

But this may not be enough, because sometimes we want to query children that has a parent satisfying some query condition.

e.g. get all children where the parents are in the `development` department.

## Matching child documents by parent criteria

We use a `has_parent` query that matches any child with parent that has any sort of match stated in the query.

```http
GET /department/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_parent": {
      "parent_type": "department",
      "query": {
        "term": {
          "name.keyword": "Development"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Looking at the query's result, we see that the `max_score` is 1. Indeed, all matches had `"_score": 1`. 

This query by default ignores the parent's relevance score. Hence the flat score of 1.

## Incorporating the parent documents' relevance scores

We can incporate the parent documents' relevance, hover, by setting `"score": true` in the `has_parent` query.

```http
GET /department/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_parent": {
      "parent_type": "department",
      "score": true,
      "query": {
        "term": {
          "name.keyword": "Development"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The relevance score of the parent is now used as the relevant score of the child, and is ranked in this way.
