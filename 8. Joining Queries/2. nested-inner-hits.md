# Nested inner hits

What if we want to which employees caused the departments to match (become a hit)?

We use an `inner_hits` key.

By doing an `inner_hits`, we can see which elements of the `nested` object actually caused the match.

Again, we search for departments who have female interns.

```http
GET /department/_search
{
  "_source": false,
  "query": {
    "nested": {
      "path": "employees",
      "inner_hits": {},
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "match": {
                "employees.position": "intern"
              }
            },
            {
              "term": {
                "employees.gender.keyword": {
                  "value": "F"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

here, `"_source": false` makes the query not return the `_source` of the hits so that it's easier for us to read.



The result is:

```json
{
  "took": 3,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 2,
    "max_score": 2.4868836,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "department",
        "_type": "_doc",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 2.4868836,
        "inner_hits": {
          "employees": {
            "hits": {
              "total": 1,
              "max_score": 2.4868836,
              "hits": [
                {
                  "_index": "department",
                  "_type": "_doc",
                  "_id": "1",
                  "_nested": {
                    "field": "employees",
                    "offset": 3
                  },
                  "_score": 2.4868836,
                  "_source": {
                    "name": "Julie Powell",
                    "age": 26,
                    "gender": "F",
                    "position": "Intern"
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      },
      ... etc.
```

we see that for this specific department hit, we can see the `inner_hits` key of the result, inside which we can see the `hits` of the `inner_hit` which caused the whole document to match. 

There we can see the `_source` of the female intern.



By default, the inner hits are sorted by relevance score.

The inner hits support some features that we haven't seen yet. This includes highlighting, source filtering, and explain API. We can use the explain API to see why some hits occured.
