# Querying parent by child documents

Just like we can do a `has_parent` query, we can also do a `has_child` query.

## Finding parents with child documents matching a `bool` query

Here, we want to search for departments that have employees who are 50 years old or more. Also, preference is for male employees.

```http
GET /department/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_child": {
      "type": "employee",
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "range": {
                "age": {
                  "gte": 50
                }
              }
            }
          ],
          "should": [
            {
              "term": {
                "gender.keyword": "M"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

here, the scoring is 1 for all parent matches.

## Taking relevance scores into account with `score_mode`

there are different types of score aggregations for the child to represent the parent's score.

| score mode | explanation                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `min`      | lowest score of matching child documents is mapped into the parent. |
| `max`      | highest score of matching child documents is mapped into the parent |
| `sum`      | the matching children's scores are summed and mapped into the parent |
| `avg`      | children's scores are averaged.                              |
| `none`     | default. The child scores isn't taken into account for scoring. |

```http
GET /department/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_child": {
      "type": "employee",
      "score_mode": "sum",
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "range": {
                "age": {
                  "gte": 50
                }
              }
            }
          ],
          "should": [
            {
              "term": {
                "gender.keyword": "M"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Specifying the minimum and maximum number of children

We can also specify how min and max of each document hit we want to have.

```http
GET /department/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_child": {
      "type": "employee",
      "score_mode": "sum",
      "min_children": 2,
      "max_children": 5,
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "range": {
                "age": {
                  "gte": 50
                }
              }
            }
          ],
          "should": [
            {
              "term": {
                "gender.keyword": "M"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```



## warning from elasticsearch

> Note that the `has_child` is a slow query compared to other queries in the query dsl due to the fact that it performs a join. The performance degrades as the number of matching child documents pointing to unique parent documents increases. If you care about query performance you should not use this query. However if you do happen to use this query then use it as little as possible. Each `has_child` query that gets added to a search request can increase query time significantly.
