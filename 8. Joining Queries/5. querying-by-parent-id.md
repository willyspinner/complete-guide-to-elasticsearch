# Querying by parent

We can simply query by parent id as follows:

```
GET /department/_search
{
  "query": {
    "parent_id": {
      "type": "employee",
      "id": 1
    }
  }
}
```

We use a `parent_id` query. 

We set `"type": "employee"` because we are searching for employees with a specific parent.

The `id` field is the parent's field.
