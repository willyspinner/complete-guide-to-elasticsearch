# Multi-level relations

What if we have multi-level relations like the following: ![image-20181229164756609](/Users/willyspinner/Desktop/elastic_tuts/complete-guide-to-elasticsearch/8. Joining Queries/assets/image-20181229164756609.png)

Where each **employee** belongs to a **department**, each **department** belongs to a **company**. And multiple **suppliers** interact to a **company**?

## Creating the index with mapping

We need to populate the mapping of the index.

each `K`-`V` entry in `relations` of `join_field` field is just a one to many relation of `K` to `V`. 

Also, `V` can be in the form of an array (as below, where one company has several departments and suppliers).

```http
PUT /company
{
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "properties": {
        "join_field": { 
          "type": "join",
          "relations": {
            "company": ["department", "supplier"],
            "department": "employee"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

note that any children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren of a parent **MUST** be routed into the **same shard** as the **parent**. This is because they are related in a single lineage.

So in effect, the four circle entities lie in the same shard as the parent company (routed to the same).

## Adding a company

As usual, put the role of each document in the `join_field` (i.e. whether it is a `company`, `department`, `supplier`  or `employee`).

```http
PUT /company/_doc/1
{
  "name": "My Company Inc.",
  "join_field": "company"
}
```

## Adding a department

```http
PUT /company/_doc/2?routing=1
{
  "name": "Development",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "department",
    "parent": 1
  }
}
```

## Adding an employee

NOTE: **NOTICE** here that the `employee` (grand-child of `company`) is routed to the same shard as the `company` .

```http
PUT /company/_doc/3?routing=1
{
  "name": "Bo Andersen",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 2
  }
}
```

## Adding some more test data
```http
PUT /company/_doc/4
{
  "name": "Another Company, Inc.",
  "join_field": "company"
}
```

```http
PUT /company/_doc/5?routing=4
{
  "name": "Marketing",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "department",
    "parent": 4
  }
}
```

```http
PUT /company/_doc/6?routing=4
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 5
  }
}
```

## Example of querying multi-level relations

we cannot just use the `has_child` query for parent and associated grand-child. `has_child` queries work in immediate relations.

So what we need to do is to nest a `has_child` under a `has_child`. This way, we will get all companies that have an employee called "John Doe".

```http
GET /company/_search
{
  "query": {
    "has_child": {
      "type": "department",
      "query": {
        "has_child": {
          "type": "employee",
          "query": {
            "term": {
              "name.keyword": "John Doe"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```



## NOTE: 

this is very slow! Be very wary of using this.
