# Adding documents

## Adding departments

To add the parents (Departments), simply specify your `join`ed field (`join_field` in this case) with a `department` role.

```http
PUT /department/_doc/1
{
  "name": "Development",
  "join_field": "department"
}
```

```http
PUT /department/_doc/2
{
  "name": "Marketing",
  "join_field":{
      "name": "department"
  } 
}
```

NOTE: the above is the same as the shorthand.

## Adding employees for departments

To specify the children, we have to specify the `parent` ID. We also need to specify the `routing` with the SAME value as the parent ID. 

This is because children **must** be stored in the **same** **shard** as their **parents** to make reliable searches.

Also, the parent's are routed by their ID by **default**, hence why we need to do this. (we **can** **specify** a **custom** routing strategy if we want, but rarely need to - and in this case, the child needs to be **routed** **accordingly**).

```http
PUT /department/_doc/3?routing=1
{
  "name": "Bo Andersen",
  "age": 28,
  "gender": "M",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 1
  }
}
```

```http
PUT /department/_doc/4?routing=2
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 44,
  "gender": "M",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 2
  }
}
```

```http
PUT /department/_doc/5?routing=1
{
  "name": "James Evans",
  "age": 32,
  "gender": "M",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 1
  }
}
```

```http
PUT /department/_doc/6?routing=1
{
  "name": "Daniel Harris",
  "age": 52,
  "gender": "M",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 1
  }
}
```

```http
PUT /department/_doc/7?routing=2
{
  "name": "Jane Park",
  "age": 23,
  "gender": "F",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 2
  }
}
```

```http
PUT /department/_doc/8?routing=1
{
  "name": "Christina Parker",
  "age": 29,
  "gender": "F",
  "join_field": {
    "name": "employee",
    "parent": 1
  }
}
```
