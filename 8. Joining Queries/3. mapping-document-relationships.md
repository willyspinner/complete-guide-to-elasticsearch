# Mapping document relationships

Here, we define a parent-children relationship of department to employee, in the same index (`department`). 

This is achieved by using the `join` field type. We put a `relations` which maps the parent to the child.

```http
PUT /department
{
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "properties": {
        "join_field": { 
          "type": "join",
          "relations": {
            "department": "employee"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
