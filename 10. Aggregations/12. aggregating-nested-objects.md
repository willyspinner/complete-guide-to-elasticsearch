# Aggregating nested objects

We now want to find the lowest age among all the employees across all the departments.

For this, we can use the `min` metric aggregation.

For aggregations, we need to use `nested` aggregations to aggregate nested documents.

```http
GET /department/_doc/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "employees": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "employees"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

What the above does is that it aggregates ALL employees into a single bucket.

Now, with this aggregation, we want to 

```http
GET /department/_doc/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "employees": {
      "nested": {
        "path": "employees"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "minimum_age": {
          "min": {
            "field": "employees.age"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```



tbh i see a better way to do this:

First, `query` all that have type `employee`. Then do a `min` metric aggregation on them.

So much easier than putting all the employees in a bucket by querying the departments...
