# Metric aggregations

These are the simplest aggregations, and we will recognize them from relational databases.

Metric aggregations are divided into two groups:

- Single-value Numeric Metric Aggregations
  - yield single metric e.g. `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`
- Multi-value Numeric Metric Aggregations
  - multiple values

## Calculating statistics with `sum`, `avg`, `min`, and `max` aggregations

We use `aggs` keyword to aggregate all documents.

The way it is done is that we aggregate all documents that are matched. 

In the `aggs`, we specify the name of our aggregated field, then the operation (e.g. `sum`), and then the `field` we want to operate our aggregation on. 

```http
GET /order/_doc/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "total_sales": {
      "sum": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    },
    "avg_sale": {
      "avg": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    },
    "min_sale": {
      "min": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    },
    "max_sale": {
      "max": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The aggregations are shown in an `aggregations` key in the results. e.g.:

```json
{
  "took": 0,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 1000,
    "max_score": 0,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "max_sale": {
      "value": 281.77
    },
    "avg_sale": {
      "value": 109.20961
    },
    "min_sale": {
      "value": 10.27
    },
    "total_sales": {
      "value": 109209.61
    }
  }
}
```

## Retrieving the number of distinct values

a `cardinality` aggregation counts the number of distinct value (like set cardinality).

NOTE: the `cardinality` aggregation is APPROXIMATE. This is because an exact calculation is a computational burden given ES' distributed nature.

```http
GET /order/_doc/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "total_salesmen": {
      "cardinality": {
        "field": "salesman.id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Retrieving the number of values

`value_count` returns the number of values.

```
GET /order/_doc/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "values_count": {
      "value_count": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Using `stats` aggregation for common statistics

`stats` is a multi-value aggregation. It returns `min`, `max`, `sum`, `avg` and `value_count`. (renamed as `count` in the aggregation field)

```
GET /order/_doc/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "amount_stats": {
      "stats": {
        "field": "total_amount"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
