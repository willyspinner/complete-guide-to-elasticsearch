### Why are document counts approximate (not exact)?

due to the fact that an index's documents is **distributed** across several shards.

Thus the only way for a wholy aggregated statistic to come up is to use local **greedy** counting in each shard (see examples for more clarity), and then aggregating this count in the coordinating node.

# cardinality example

Suppose we want to find the cardinality of id fields in documents. (i.e. how many unique documents do we have) - which in actuality, is 25.

Suppose the documents are distributed into 5 shards. 

Each shard, limited with only their set of data, counts their own cardinalities (this is what I mean by 'greedy').

So it may be that one shard only has 4 cardinality, yet another has 22, and another has 3, and so on, which sums up to more than 25.

(although this example is rather extreme).

## Top 3 buckets example

This is similar to the cardinality example above. Here we have an example of six types of products A, B, C, D, E and F, spread across three shards.

The task is to find the **top** **three** popular products.

What happens, like the above, is that each shard finds its own top three popular products (as above), and sends this information to the coordinating node.

The coordinating node then aggregates this data by summation, and then displays the top three products as above. As we can see, due to this rather **greedy** approach, we get an inaccurate answer.

This miscounting becomes more significant when we lower the `size` count.

Nevertheless, take note that elasticsearch usually takes the top 10 (`size=10`), and thus can still be more accurate than this.

(note: `size` means the aggs term `size` in below:)

```http
GET /order/_doc/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "status_terms": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "status.keyword",
        "size": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### so? tradeoff...

It is really a tradeoff between accuracy (big `size`, but slow) vs performance (low `size`, but fast).

It is **highly recommended** that we stay with the default of 10, **even if** we only need the top three terms.
