# Filtering out documents

We can filter out documents **efore** running an aggregation.

## Filtering out documents with low `total_amount`

```
GET /order/_doc/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "low_value": {
      "filter": {
        "range": {
          "total_amount": {
            "lt": 50
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

here, we're just getting the document count of the `low_value` aggregation, which filters out all documents that have `total_amount` greater than or equal to 50.

NOTE that `filter` is a type of aggregation. Although more accurately, it is a pre-aggregation operation.

You're just filtering things out, and then making the remaining things left into one **bucket**.

We get :

```json
{
  "took": 31,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 1000,
    "max_score": 0,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "low_value": {
      "doc_count": 164
    }
  }
}
```

We would get the same 164 documents if we were to do a standard bool filter query, i.e.:

```http
GET /order/_doc/_search
{
  "query":{
  "bool": {
      "filter": {
        "range": {
          "total_amount": {
            "lt": 50
          }
        }
      } 
    }
  }
}
```

## Aggregating on the bucket of remaining documents

```http
GET /order/_doc/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "low_value": {
      "filter": {
        "range": {
          "total_amount": {
            "lt": 50
          }
        }
      },
      "aggs": {
        "avg_amount": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "total_amount"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Following on from the above, we now run a further aggregation to get the average `total_amount` of the documents.

We get:

```json
{
  "took": 4,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 1000,
    "max_score": 0,
    "hits": []
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "low_value": {
      "doc_count": 164,
      "avg_amount": {
        "value": 32.59371951219512
      }
    }
  }
}
```
