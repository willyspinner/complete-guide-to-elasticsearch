# Proximity searches

Here, we want to relax the `match_phrase` query by not having to necessitate contiguity.

e.g. `1  3 ` query still matches `aaa 1 2 3 ss` document since `1` and `3` is still 'close' to each other.

## Adding test documents

```
PUT /proximity/_doc/1
{
  "title": "Spicy Sauce"
}
```

```
PUT /proximity/_doc/2
{
  "title": "Spicy Tomato Sauce"
}
```

```
PUT /proximity/_doc/3
{
  "title": "Spicy Tomato and Garlic Sauce"
}
```

```
PUT /proximity/_doc/4
{
  "title": "Tomato Sauce (spicy)"
}
```

```
PUT /proximity/_doc/5
{
  "title": "Spicy and very delicious Tomato Sauce"
}
```

## Adding the `slop` parameter to a `match_phrase` query

To relax the `match_phrase`, we add a `slop` parameter. This just means HOW far apart in terms of words, the terms of the query can be 

(**NOTE** -  maintaining order isn't exactly necessary, as swapping the term's order whhile stil contiguous is counted as a `slop` move. However, order preservation still boosts score).

e.g. slop=1 would mean `spicy sauce` query matches `spicy a sauce`.

slop=3 would mean `spicy sauce` query matches `spicy a b c sauce`. (although I think higher sloppiness would mean higher performance sacrifice, so maybe use this carefully).



```http
GET /proximity/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": {
        "query": "spicy sauce",
        "slop": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```http
GET /proximity/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": {
        "query": "spicy sauce",
        "slop": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For this one, notice that we have a `slop` of 2. This is visualised as follows:

So the operation of bringing one word to its contiguous position is one `slop`, even though two words now occupy a single position (as above).

## relevance scoring

The **less** **sloppy** the match is, the **higher** the relevance score. This is because we have less 'distance' and a more 'exact' match.
