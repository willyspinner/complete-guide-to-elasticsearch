# Adding synonyms from file

We can add synonyms from a file (which is more convenient).

see here:

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-synonym-tokenfilter.html

## Adding index with custom analyzer

NOTE: we can specify an absolute path instead in `synonyms_path` as well, to make it easier.

```http
PUT /synonyms
{
  "settings": {
    "analysis": {
      "filter": {
        "synonym_test": {
          "type": "synonym",
          "synonyms_path": "analysis/synonyms.txt"
        }
      },
      "analyzer": {
        "my_analyzer": {
          "tokenizer": "standard",
          "filter": [
            "lowercase",
            "synonym_test"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "properties": {
        "description": {
          "type": "text",
          "analyzer": "my_analyzer"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Synonyms file (`config/analysis/synonyms.txt`)

```
# This is a comment

awful => terrible
awesome => great, super
elasticsearch, logstash, kibana => elk
weird, strange
```

## Complications when we change the synonym file

Initially, when given a synonym file upon creation of an index, ES indexes its whole index by using the synonym token filter.

But when we change the synonym file afterwards, ES doesn't re-index all the indices, yet applies the new synonyms when analyzing queries.   

Consider the below:

![image-20181230184417142](/Users/willyspinner/Desktop/elastic_tuts/complete-guide-to-elasticsearch/11. Improving Search Results/assets/image-20181230184417142.png)

When we add that document, it is **indexed** as `elasticsearch`.  There is no synonym for `elasticsearch`.

But when we add the new synonym (`elasticsearch => elk`), all `elasticsearch` queries are transformed into `elk`. 

So we will never find this `elasticsearch` document.

## how to solve this?

Use the `_update_by_query` API, which will re-index the documents.

```http
POST /synonyms/_update_by_query
```

From elastic.co:

> The simplest usage of `_update_by_query` just performs an update on every document in the index without changing the source. This is useful to [pick up a new property](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-update-by-query.html#picking-up-a-new-property) or some other online mapping change.
