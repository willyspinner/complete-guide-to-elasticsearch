# Fuzzy `match` query

When users make a typo in their search, the desired documents will not match.

Fuzziness allows for fuzzy searching based on the Damerau-levenshtein edit distance, so that these typos will be caught.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance for more details.

## Searching with `fuzziness` set to `auto`

Fuzziness is on a per-term basis.

```http
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": {
        "query": "l0bster",
        "fuzziness": "auto"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `auto` `fuzziness` means that the allowance of character typos (edit distance) increases as the term's length increases. 

Recall that ES fuzzily looks into each term of the query (analyzed). 

![image-20181230172327580](/Users/willyspinner/Desktop/elastic_tuts/complete-guide-to-elasticsearch/11. Improving Search Results/assets/image-20181230172327580.png)

So for example, with a `fuzziness` of `auto`,  the query `L0bster Love` would match the document with name`Live Lobster` because each of the terms just need one edit to match.

The maximum edit distance for all terms with more than 5 characters is 2. Why? Interestingly..

* studies have shown that 80% of human mispellings can be corrected by an edit distance of 1 (at most 2)
* being able to specify a higher edit distance would **reduce** **performance**, and we would also begin to see **strange** and **unpredictable** **results**.

So leaving the value in `auto` is generally the best idea.

## Fuzziness is per term (and specifying an integer)

We can also manually specify the `fuzziness` (maximum edit distance) of the query. Here, we are specifying it to strictly 1.

```http
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": {
        "query": "l0bster love",
        "operator": "and",
        "fuzziness": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Switching letters around with transpositions

Note, by default, the levenshtein edit distance calculates edit distance by:

- insertion
- deletion
- substitution (replace one letter with another letter)

The *Damerau-Levenshtein* edit distance (the one used by default), however, can account for character transpositions, i.e. swapping two characters in the term. 

e.g. `LVIE`- > `LIVE` (swap `I` and `V`) is one edit in this algorithm.

(NOTE: we don't need to turn this option on. It's on by default.)

```http
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": {
        "query": "lvie",
        "fuzziness": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that tranpositions are particularly useful because sometimes, we type keys mistakenly ahead of others (e.g. lvie instead of live). It is a human error.

## Disabling transpositions

By turning `fuzzy_transpositions` to `false`, we turn the algorithm from *Damerau-Levenshtein* into *Levenshtein*.

```http
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": {
        "query": "lvie",
        "fuzziness": 1,
        "fuzzy_transpositions": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```
