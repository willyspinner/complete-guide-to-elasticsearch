# `fuzzy` query

There is another type of fuzzy query that differs from the fuzzy match.

The `fuzzy` query here is a term-level query, so the input query is not analyzed (tokenized, lowercased, etc.).

So to search an actual document that has `name` of `lobster`, the below will not match:

```http
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "fuzzy": {
      "name": {
        "value": "LOBSTER",
        "fuzziness": "auto"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It can only match if we set the `fuzziness` into 7, which substitutes all letters into lowercase (and is ridiculous).

```http
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "fuzzy": {
      "name": {
        "value": "lobster",
        "fuzziness": "auto"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `match` `fuzzy` query is generally preferred over this term-level `fuzzy` query because of the benefits of normalization due to analysis.
