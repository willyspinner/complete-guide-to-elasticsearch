# Adding synonyms

For our purposes, some words effectively mean the same thing. So why write them differently?

Recall that analysers are defined in the index's mapping, and is used to create an inverted index from the index. We use this inverted index to search efficiently.

The `synonym` filter type can turn synoynms into their original word.

Notice how above, the match query does work when `awful` is a synonym of `terrible`. Yet a term-level query like below doesn't work since the inverted index only contains the original word (`terrible`) and not the synonym.

# synonym specification syntax

There are three ways of specifying synonyms:

| method                             | desc.                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `awful => terrible`                | `awful` is replaced with `terrible`                         |
| `elastic, logstash, kibana => elk` | `elastic`, `logstash` and `kibana` are replaced with `elk`  |
| `wierd, strange`                   | both of the two terms would be placed at the same position. |

## Creating index with custom analyzer

Here, we create the `synonym` filter inside our custom analyzer.

```http
PUT /synonyms
{
  "settings": {
    "analysis": {
      "filter": {
        "synonym_test": {
          "type": "synonym", 
          "synonyms": [
            "awful => terrible",
            "awesome => great, super",
            "elasticsearch, logstash, kibana => elk",
            "weird, strange"
          ]
        }
      },
      "analyzer": {
        "my_analyzer": {
          "tokenizer": "standard",
          "filter": [
            "lowercase",
            "synonym_test"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "properties": {
        "description": {
          "type": "text",
          "analyzer": "my_analyzer"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Let's examine the `awesome => great, super` entry below.

`awesome` will be replaced by `great` and `super` within the inverted index.

E.g. when we analyze the query text below with this synonym filter, we get:

![image-20181230181203617](/Users/willyspinner/Desktop/elastic_tuts/complete-guide-to-elasticsearch/11. Improving Search Results/assets/image-20181230181203617.png)

The reason why the replacement (`great, super`) is placed in a single position is that we want to conserve the position order even though we have multiple synonyms.

Otherwise, then `match_phrase` queries may be misleading.

The process is similarly described as below:

## how to test synonym token filters

Note: we can see how the synonyms turn out by:

    POST /synonyms/_analyze
    {
        "analyzer": "my_analyzer",
        "text": "your text here"
    }
## how to test synonym token filters

Note: we can see how the synonyms turn out by:

```http
POST /synonyms/_analyze
{
    "analyzer": "my_analyzer",
    "text": "your text here"
}
```



# Order matters when you add token filters!

Look above in the HTTP request for the index.

```json
          "filter": [
            "lowercase",
            "synonym_test"
          ]
```

Here, we specify that the `lowercase` token filter should go before the `synonym_test`.  Thus, the synonym terms MUST be in lowercase as well.
