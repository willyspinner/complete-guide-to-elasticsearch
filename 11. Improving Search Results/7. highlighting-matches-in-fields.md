# Highlighting matches in fields

We can get ES to highlight the matches in a document.

The highlighted matches get surrounded by a pair of  `<em> ` tags.

## Adding a test document

```http
POST /highlighting/_doc/1
{
  "description": "Let me tell you a story about Elasticsearch. It's a full-text search engine that is built on Apache Lucene. It's really easy to use, but also packs lots of advanced features that you can use to tweak its searching capabilities. Lots of well-known and established companies use Elasticsearch, and so should you!"
}
```

## Highlighting matches within the `description` field

To specify highlights, simply write the `hihglight` key below and specify the `fields` to be highlighted.

Inside the specified fields, we can specify highlighting options (but don't need to - things get complicated fast).

```http
GET /highlighting/_doc/_search
{
  "_source": false,
  "query": {
    "match": { "description": "Elasticsearch story" }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "fields": {
      "description" : {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Result

We get the following results:

```json
...
highlight": {
          "description": [
            "Let me tell you a <em>story</em> about <em>Elasticsearch</em>.",
            "Lots of well-known and established companies use <em>Elasticsearch</em>, and so should you!"
          ]
        }
,....

```

The highlight returns a `description` array which contains the highlighted matches in correct order.

## Specifying a custom tag

we can add custom html tags to surround our `highlight`ed words.

```http
GET /highlighting/_doc/_search
{
  "_source": false,
  "query": {
    "match": { "description": "Elasticsearch story" }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "pre_tags": [ "<strong>" ],
    "post_tags": [ "</strong>" ],
    "fields": {
      "description" : {}
    }
  }
}
```
