# Full text queries vs term level queries

we can use two groups of queries to search for data - term and full-text queries.

## Term level queries are not analyzed

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "name": "lobster"
    }
  }
}
```

gets 5 matches.

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "name": "Lobster"
    }
  }
}
```

gets 0 matches.

We observe that in term queries, the difference in capitalization may make it not match.

## Full-text queries are analyzed

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": "Lobster"
    }
  }
}
```

a match query (full-text) does match, even though it is capitalized.



# why?

Both term-level and full-text queries search for **EXACT** values. But they differ in whether the input to be searched is **analyzed** or not. term-level doesn't, but full-text does. Now why does this matter?

We see here that the query for `lobster` does have matches since the values in the inverted index have undergone `standard` analysis (converted to lower case, etc.)

`Lobster`, however, doesn't have matches since `Lobster` !=[ `lobster` in the inverted index].

In other words, the value to be searched for, in the term query, is **NOT ANALYZED** prior to being used in the query.

### in match queries however..

we get matches, because the `Lobster` query input gets analyzed (and thus lowercased), which matches with `lobster` in the inverted index.
