# Introducing the Query DSL

In ES, we have two types of queries. Leaf queries, and compound queries.

## ![image-20181229020103517](/Users/willyspinner/Desktop/elastic_tuts/complete-guide-to-elasticsearch/4. Introduction to Searching/assets/image-20181229020103517.png)

leaf queries search for values within particular fields whereas compound queries consist of multiple leaf or compound queries themselves. 

an example of a compound query would be to match documents with category of `fruit` or `vegetable`.

## Matching all documents

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}
```

`match_all` matches ALL documents. It is the most simple query, and gives all documents a `_score` of 1.0. (more on scores later.)

## understanding query results

`took` is how many milliseconds the query took.

`timed_out` is whether the search request timed out.

`_shards` represented how many shards were actually searched, and how many were successful/failed.

`hits` contains the search results.

-  `total` is how many documents were matched
- `max_score`: highest match score (relevant score)
- `hits`  - array of matches - by default the first 10 documents of the match are returned, but this can be edited.
  - each document has a:
    - `_score`- its relevance score.

```json
{
  "took": 10,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 2,
    "max_score": 6.940834,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "product-tuts",
        "_type": "default",
        "_id": "65",
        "_score": 6.940834,
        "_source": {
          "name": "Tuna - Bluefin",
          "price": 27
        }.. etc..
```
