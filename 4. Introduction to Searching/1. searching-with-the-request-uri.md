# Searching with the request URI

Normally, ES queries use a JSON request body DSL. We can use a request URI (query string) method, however:

## Matching all documents

```
GET /product/_doc/_search?q=*
```

## Matching documents containing the term `Lobster`

```
GET /product/_doc/_search?q=name:Lobster
```

## Matching documents containing the tag `Meat`

```
GET /product/_doc/_search?q=tags:Meat
```

here `tags` is an array in the document (we specified, and is put in `_source`.)

## Matching documents containing the tag `Meat` _and_ name `Tuna`

```
GET /product/_doc/_search?q=tags:Meat AND name:Tuna
```

here, `name` is an attribute of the data. 

NOTE that we have to encode spaces with %20 because this is in the URL.
