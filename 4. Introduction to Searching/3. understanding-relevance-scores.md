# Understanding relevance scores

Recall that when we query, we get the hits sorted in descending relevance score.

What is relevance score?

Historically, relevance is calculated by `TF-IDF`. (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency). Concretely:
$$
\text{TF}(t,p) = \frac{\text{# of times term t appears in document  }p} { \text{Total # of terms in  document }p}
$$

$$
\text{IDF}(t) = ln\bigg(\frac{\text{Total # of documents }}{\text{# of documents with term t in it}}\bigg)
$$

Presumably, for a specific document $p$, and a specific term $t$, its TF-IDF score is:
$$
\text{TF-IDF}(t,p)=\text{TF}(t,p)\text{IDF}(t)
$$


Now, however, ES uses  Okapi BM25.

BM25 is better at handling stop words. (it does this automatically). It also improves the field-length norm factor (doesn't boost the score that much if the term is used a lot in a document).



NOTE: calculating term frequency and DF (used by okapi BM25) is on a per-shard basis. Meaning, we cannot count ALL documents in the index that has a specified term, which may sound bad and inaccurate.

This, however, probably will not affect us a lot, since the shards are quite even.

## how to explain searches

We can see how ES searches by doing the following:

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "explain": true,
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "name": "lobster"
    }
  }
}
```

we can also use the querystring of `?explain` and just put the query DSL without the `explain` attribute.
