# Searching with regular expressions

We can search for terms matching regex for  a field.

ES uses lucene's regex syntax, so not all regex syntax is available.

not supported:

 - character classes (e.g. `\d`)
 - anchors (`$` and `^`) - this wouldn't be useful anyway, cos we're searching at the term level.



When using `regexp` matches, performance may vary. Generally, we shouldn't use wildcard patterns initially in the expression - this is a real performance killer.



If  We need to use wildcards, we should use it after some long prefix so the combinations to look for isn't as much.

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "regexp": {
      "tags.keyword": "Veg[a-zA-Z]+ble"
    }
  }
}
```
