# Searching with wildcards

wildcard queries are unix-like wildcards like 

`?`  (match single character) and `*` (zero or more characters).

**WARNING**: wild card queries can be slow because it needs to iterate over a lot of terms, and won't scale well. 

We should be especially careful of putting an asterisk or a question mark at the beginning - this should ideally be avoided.



## Adding an asterisk for any characters (zero or more)

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "wildcard": {
      "tags.keyword": "Veg*ble"
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding a question mark for any single character

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "wildcard": {
      "tags.keyword": "Veg?ble"
    }
  }
}
```

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "wildcard": {
      "tags.keyword": "Veget?ble"
    }
  }
}
```
