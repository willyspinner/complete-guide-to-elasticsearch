# Searching for a term

recall: term queries are not themselves analysed. So we should use term queries for EXACT matching only. e.g. number fields, dates, keyword fields.

## Matching documents with a value of `true` for the `is_active` field

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "is_active": true
    }
  }
}
```

The below is another version for searching the `is_active` field. It allows us to add options on the field to search (more on this later).

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "is_active": {
        "value": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
