# Matching documents with non-null values

We can do an `exists` query to get all documents that don't have a null value for a specified field. 

What is a `non-null` value?

> any value that is not null 

 - NOTE that an empty string DOES is `non-null`.
 - An empty array is `null`, since it doesn't have any `non-null` element.

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "exists": {
      "field": "tags"
    }
  }
}
```
