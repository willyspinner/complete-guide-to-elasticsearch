# Searching for multiple terms

Just like the single term query, but this time we can match multiple terms (for a keyword).

here, `tags` is a keyword field and a text field (multi-field mapping default by ES).

Also, here, since we are searching for multiple terms, we use `terms`. We want to search for documents that have `Soup` or `Cake` as a tag.

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "terms": {
      "tags.keyword": [ "Soup", "Cake" ]
    }
  }
}
```
