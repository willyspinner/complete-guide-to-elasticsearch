# Adding mappings to existing indices

## Adding mapping for `discount` field

we can just expicitly define mappings for field right away.  e.g. to define the mapping for the `discount` field:

```
PUT /product/default/_mapping
{
  "properties": {
    "discount": {
      "type": "double"
    }
  }
}
```

## Retrieving mapping

to make sure our mapping is good, simply see by:

```
GET /product/default/_mapping
```
