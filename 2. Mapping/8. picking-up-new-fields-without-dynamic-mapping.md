# Picking up new fields without dynamic mapping

what happens when we add new documents with missing fields when the index is statically mapped? 

## Adding test document

```
POST /product/_doc/2000
{
  "description": "Test",
  "discount": 20
}
```

## Adding mapping for `discount` field

```
PUT /product/default/_mapping
{
  "properties": {
    "discount": {
      "type": "integer"
    }
  }
}
```

## Querying the `description` field

```
GET /product/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "description": "Test"
    }
  }
}
```

in this case, the document matches.

## Querying the `discount` field

```
GET /product/default/_search
{
  "query": {
    "term": {
      "discount": 20
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, NO documents match. Why is this? we disabled dynamic mappings. So ES will ignore fields for which there are no mappings. The values will not be indexed.

## Picking up new mappings for documents

```
POST /product/_update_by_query?conflicts=proceed
```

The simplest usage of `_update_by_query` just performs an update on every document in the index without changing the source. This is useful to [pick up a new property](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-update-by-query.html#picking-up-a-new-property) or some other online mapping change.

## Deleting the test document

```
DELETE /product/_doc/2000
```
