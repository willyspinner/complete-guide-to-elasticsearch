# meta fields

meta fields are fields that are given for every document.

| name of metafield | description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `_index`          | contains name of index to which a document belongs. Added by ES automatically and used by ES internally. |
| `_id`             | stores id of documents (needed when updating or deleting documents specifically) |
| `_source`         | contains the original JSON object used when indexing a document. This is not indexed, and therefore we **can**'**t** **search** it, but we can still retrieve it. |
| `_field_names`    | contains names of every field that contains a non-null value for a given document. |
| `_routing`        | stores value used to route a document to a shard (we don't need to deal with this unless we are doing custom routing) |
| `_version`        | stores the internal version of a document. This is returned when we query for documents. It starts with 1, and is incremented by 1 everytime we update it. |
| `_meta`           | store custom data that is left untouched by ES. We can use this for that purpose. |

Question: so how do we index the `_source` field?
