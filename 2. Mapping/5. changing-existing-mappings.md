# Changing existing mappings

Existing mappings for fields cannot be updated. Instead, you have to delete the index, and then create index with new mappings.

This is important, because if we were to change the mappings of the fields ,we would invalidate any existing documents that had already been added to the index.

Also, some indexing problems may occur.

## Deleting the index

```
DELETE /product
```

## Creating index with mappings

Then we finally create the new index with mappings right away:

 (we disable dynamic mapping here since we're defining the mappings explicitly)

```
PUT /product
{
  "mappings": {
    "default": {
      "dynamic": false, 
      "properties": {
        "in_stock": {
          "type": "integer"
        },
        "is_active": {
          "type": "boolean"
        },
        "price": {
          "type": "integer"
        },
        "sold": {
          "type": "long"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```



# exceptions

we can add new properties for fields with the object data type, and we can also add additional mappings to existing fields.  e.g. we can add "keyword" mapping to text fields.
