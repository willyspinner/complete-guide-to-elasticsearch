Essentially, mappings are used to define how documents and their fields should be stored and indexed.

The point of doing this is to **store** and index **data** in a way that is **appropriate** for how we want to **search** our data.



mapping could be used to determine which fields could be treated as full text fields, which fields contain numbers, dates, or geographical locations.

This is also important for specifying analyzers, which will be looked at next.

Mappings are sort of like schemas in relational databases.
