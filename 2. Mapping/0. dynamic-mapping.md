# Dynamic mapping

so far, when adding an index and its documents, we haven't defined any mappings explicitly. 

Elasticsearch does this for us, it sees incoming documents' data types, and guesses the mappings for us automatially. 

However, sometimes, it may add two mappings for the same field because it is unsure. This is when we have to explicitly state the type of the mapping.

## Retrieving mapping

This is how we see the mappings of our index.

```
GET /product/default/_mapping
```
