# core data types

| name                                            | desc.                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `text`                                          | used to **index** full-text value such as descriptions. Values are analyzed (more on this later). They are rarely used for sorting and aggregating documents. |
| `keyword`                                       | used for structured data (tags, categories, emails). Not analyzed. Typically used for filtering and aggregations. |
| `long`, `integer`, `byte`, `float`, etc.        | numeric data types.                                          |
| `date`                                          | represents dates as either string, long or integer (secs since epoch). |
| `boolean`                                       | true or false                                                |
| `binary`                                        | accepts as base64 encoded binary value. Not stored by default. |
| range values: `integer_rage`, `long_rage`, etc. | used for range vlaues such as date ranges or numeric ranges. we define ranges as lower and upper bounds: `{"gte": 10, "lte:" 20}` |

NOTE: `text` analysis menas that the field is stored in a way that is optimal for performing full-text searches. Not being analysed means the value is stored as is.

# complex data types

| name     | desc.                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `object` | added as JSON objects, stored as flattened key-value pairs internally (e.g. `"object.key1": value`, `"object.key2": value2` instead of the nesting) |
| `array`  | NOTE: all elements must be of same data type. ALSO, if we use an array of objects, we cannot query individual objects independently of the other objects in the array, due to the flattening nature of ES. |
| `nested` | enables arrays of objects to be queried independently of each other. |

# geo data types

| name                                                    | desc.                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `geo_point`                                             | `lat` `lon`                                                  |
| `geo_shape`, `point`, `polygon`, `multipoint`, `circle` | used for geographical shapes such as polygons, circles, etc. we can define geo-fences, and other things. |

# specialized data types

| name         | desc.                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ip`         | IPV4 or IPV6                                                 |
| `completion` | used to provide auto-completion ("search as you type") functionality. Optimized for quick lookups. We use ES`suggesters`, which is covered later in the course. |
| `attachment` | indexing documents that contain text, and to make the text searchable. E.g. we have pdf or word documents that neads to be indexed. |
