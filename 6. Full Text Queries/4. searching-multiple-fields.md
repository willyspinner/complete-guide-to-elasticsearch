# Searching multiple fields

We can also search multiple fields for a single query match.

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match": {
      "query": "pasta",
      "fields": [ "title", "description" ]
    }
  }
}
```

The way relevance here is scored is the following:
$$
\text{relv}(q,d, F) = \text{max}\bigg(\text{relv}(q,d,f_1), ...,\text{relv}(q,d,f_i)\bigg)
$$
for a query text $q$, 

a document $d$,

and a collection of fields to be searched $f_i \in F$.

So the fields are scored individually for relevance, and the highest scoring field becomes representative of that entire document's relevance.



Elasticsearch takes the terms and executes a match query for each one (not covered).
