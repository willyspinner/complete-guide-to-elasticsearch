# Flexible matching with `match` query

recall - term level queries are used for exact term-level matches (the query isn't analysed).

But match queries are analysed.

A standard `match` query analyses the query text, and scores its relevance by the terms of the query and how many of those terms are present in the document (without any regard to order - see `match_phrase` for order).

## Standard `match` query

here, we're doing a query against the title `Recipes with pasta or spaghetti`.

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "Recipes with pasta or spaghetti"
    }
  }
}
```

then we get:

```json

  "took": 7,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": 17,
    "max_score": 2.6974046,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "recipe",
        "_type": "_doc",
        "_id": "11",
        "_score": 2.6974046,
        "_source": {
          "title": "Spaghetti Puttanesca (Pasta or Spaghetti With Capers, Olives, and Anchovies)",
          "description": """"Puttanesca" literally translates to "in the style of prostitutes," supposedly because the pungent aromas of garlic, anchovies, capers, and olives tossed with pasta were how Neapolitan prostitutes would lead customers to their doors. This is one of those stories that seem, in the words of Douglas Adams, apocryphal or at least wildly inaccurate. That said, it's a fitting titleâ€”puttanesca packs an aromatic punch and then some.""",
          "preparati
```

here, this document is the most relevant since the title has `Pasta or spaghetti` in the text. 

If we were to do a `term` query instead, there would be no matches since the query text wouldn't be analyzed.

Note that all terms of the query do not have to appear in the document for it to be scored more than 0. It is an `OR` boolean query. 

So we could get a recipe that has the title `butternut squash pasta` since `pasta` is included in the query text.

To make it such that it is an `AND` query (All terms MUST appear), then we specify it as below:

## Specifying a boolean operator

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "Recipes with pasta or spaghetti",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "pasta or spaghetti",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

the above gets 1 hit, that is the `puttanesca pasta` document we got in the beginning.

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "pasta spaghetti",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
