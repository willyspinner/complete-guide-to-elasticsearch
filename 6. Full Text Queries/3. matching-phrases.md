# Matching phrases

`match_phrase` queries are a variation of the `match` query. This time though, the order of the query text **DOES** matter. (hence why it is called a `phrase` match).

## The order of terms matters

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": "spaghetti puttanesca"
    }
  }
}
```

Returns 1 hit (the spaghetti puttanesca document). yet..

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": "puttanesca spaghetti"
    }
  }
}
```

Doesn't return **anything**. This is because the phrase is reversed, and the order matters.



`match_phrase` scores relevance by **ORDER** preservation (most important) and the presence of query terms.

Also, `match_phrase` will show documents that have the query phrase in a **Contiguous** manner.

So for a `match_phrase` of "puttanesca spaghetti", the title `puttanesca ting of spaghetti` **Won't** match.
