# Filters

Recall that queries can be run in the filter or query context. The difference is that query context asks for relevance, filter doesn't - filter is yes or no.

Recall that filters:

- cache results so we improve performance
- don't have to calculate relevance scores so saves computational burden

## Adding a `filter` clause to the `bool` query

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "title": "pasta"
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```



NOTE: isn't this a hybrid query? wait for bo's response.
