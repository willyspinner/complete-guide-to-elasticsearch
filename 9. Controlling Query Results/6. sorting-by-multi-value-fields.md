# Sorting by multi-value fields

We can also sort multi-value fields, meaning being able to sort fields such as arrays. 

## Sorting by the average rating (descending)

Here, `rating` is an array of floats. So what happens is that we want to sort recipes according to their average `rating`s in descending order. 

This is known as an aggregation (like in relational databases). 

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "_source": "ratings",
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  },
  "sort": [
    {
      "ratings": {
        "order": "desc",
        "mode": "avg"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

There is also `sum`,`median` for only numeric values.

`min` and `max` can work not only with numeric values (e.g. dates).
