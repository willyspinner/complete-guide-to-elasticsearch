# Source filtering

By default, the entire `_source` is returned.

But sometimes, we want to limit what is returned, so that we reduce the amount of data returned and thereby transferred on the network.

This is essential for high-throughput applications.

## Excluding the `_source` field altogether

We disable `_source` when we don't need it at all- e.g. when finding the ids of documents.

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "_source": false,
  "query": {
    "match": { "title": "pasta" }
  }
}
```

## Only returning the `created` field

We can specify which field of the `_source` we want to be returned. 

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "_source": "created",
  "query": {
    "match": { "title": "pasta" }
  }
}
```

Then in the result, the `_source` key would be as follows:

```json
...etc...
"_source": {
	"created": "some date"
},
...etc...
```



NOTE: you can return more keys by specifying in an array:

```json
...etc...
"_source": ["created", "servings"],
...etc...
```



## Only returning an object's key

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "_source": "ingredients.name",
  "query": {
    "match": { "title": "pasta" }
  }
}
```

## Returning all of an object's keys

the `ingredients.*` expression is the glob that will return all of the `ingredients` keys.

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "_source": "ingredients.*",
  "query": {
    "match": { "title": "pasta" }
  }
}
```

## Returning the `ingredients` object with all keys, __and__ the `servings` field

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "_source": [ "ingredients.*", "servings" ],
  "query": {
    "match": { "title": "pasta" }
  }
}
```

## Including all of the `ingredients` object's keys, except the `name` key

`excludes` key is used to exclude any unwanted key.

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "_source": {
    "includes": "ingredients.*",
    "excludes": "ingredients.name"
  },
  "query": {
    "match": { "title": "pasta" }
  }
}
```
