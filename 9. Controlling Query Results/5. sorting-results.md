# Sorting results

By default, hits are sorted from highest scores to lowest scores.

just ad a simple `sort` key in the query to put what to sort.

## Sorting by ascending order (implicitly)

(Note: default order is ascending).

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "_source": false,
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  },
  "sort": [
    "preparation_time_minutes"
  ]
}
```

## Sorting by descending order

use `desc` for specifying descending order.

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "_source": "created",
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  },
  "sort": [
    { "created": "desc" }
  ]
}
```

## Sorting by multiple fields

here we do a primary sort on `preparation_time_minutes`, and a secondary sort on `created`, in ascending and descending order respectively.

```
GET /recipe/_doc/_search
{
  "_source": [ "preparation_time_minutes", "created" ],
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  },
  "sort": [
    { "preparation_time_minutes": "asc" },
    { "created": "desc" }
  ]
}
```
